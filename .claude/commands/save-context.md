**Save context now.** Update these before the session ends:

1. **Session context** (`.meridian/session-context.md`)
   - Key decisions made and why
   - Important discoveries or blockers
   - Current state of work in progress
   - Anything hard to rediscover

2. **Pebble** (if enabled)
   - Update issue status
   - Add comments with progress
   - Create issues for discovered work

3. **Worktree context** (if in a worktree)
   - Update `.meridian/worktree-context.md` in main worktree
   - 2-3 sentences: what was worked on, current state

After updating, confirm what was saved.
