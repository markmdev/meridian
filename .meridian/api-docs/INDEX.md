# External Tools & APIs

Knowledge docs for external tools, APIs, and libraries. Each doc contains everything you need to work with that tool: overview, current state, API operations, limits, gotchas.

**Rule: You MUST NOT write code using an external tool unless it's documented here. If you need a tool that isn't listed (or need info not covered), run the `docs-researcher` agent first.**

## When to Read These Docs

- Before writing ANY code that uses an external tool
- When planning features that involve external integrations
- When you need current info (versions, models, limits)
- When something isn't working as expected

## When to Run docs-researcher

- Tool not listed below
- Listed but missing the operations/info you need
- Need to verify current state (versions change, models get deprecated)
- Uncertain about limits, pricing tiers, or constraints
