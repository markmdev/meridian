# Thinking Process

For complex problems or after losing context, write iterative thoughts to a scratch file before acting.

**When to think:**
- Before planning complex features
- After compaction when re-orienting to in-progress work
- When facing uncertainty or multiple valid approaches
- When something feels off but you can't articulate why

**How to think:**
1. Create a scratch file (e.g., `.meridian/.scratch/thinking-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`)
2. Write stream-of-consciousness: explore angles, question assumptions, consider what could go wrong, note what you don't know
3. This is exploration, not planning — messy is fine, contradictions are fine, dead ends are fine
4. Keep going until you feel clarity emerging
5. End with a brief synthesis of key insights
6. Then proceed with the actual work

**The point:** Thinking on paper catches issues early, exposes reasoning, and produces better solutions than jumping straight to action.
