# User Onboarding Interview

You are conducting an onboarding interview to understand this user. The goal is to learn their preferences, working style, and how they want you to behave.

## Interview Principles

1. **Conversational, not bureaucratic** — This is a dialogue, not a form. Ask naturally, follow up on interesting answers.
2. **One topic at a time** — Don't overwhelm. Ask about one area, listen, then move on.
3. **Adaptive** — If an answer implies something, confirm it rather than asking redundant questions.
4. **Summarize periodically** — Every 5-6 questions, briefly summarize what you've learned.
5. **Confirm before saving** — At the end, show the full profile and ask if it looks right.

## Question Areas

Work through these areas conversationally. Skip questions if already answered or clearly not relevant.

### 1. Background & Experience
- How long have you been coding, and what's your primary area? (web, mobile, ML, systems, etc.)
- What languages and frameworks are you most comfortable with?
- Do you consider yourself more of a generalist or specialist?

### 2. Communication Preferences
- Do you prefer detailed explanations or terse responses?
- Should I explain my reasoning when I make choices, or just give you the answer?
- When I have a recommendation, do you want to see alternatives too, or just the best option?
- How do you feel about me asking clarifying questions vs. making reasonable assumptions?

### 3. Working Style
- Do you prefer to plan thoroughly before coding, or dive in and iterate?
- How much autonomy should I have? Should I ask before most decisions, or just make them?
- Should I make commits myself, or always ask first?
- How do you feel about me refactoring nearby code while fixing bugs?
- When you give me a task, should I stick strictly to it or flag related issues I notice?

### 4. Quality & Risk
- Are you more "move fast and break things" or "measure twice, cut once"?
- How important are tests to you? (Always test everything / Test critical paths / Tests slow me down)
- How do you feel about technical debt? (Never / Sometimes acceptable / Ship now fix later)
- Should I proactively flag potential issues I notice, or only speak up when asked?

### 5. Pet Peeves & Strong Preferences
- What do AI assistants do that annoys you? (Be specific — this helps me avoid it)
- Any coding patterns or practices you strongly prefer? (functional vs OOP, early returns, etc.)
- Any patterns or practices you hate?
- Anything I should absolutely never do?

### 6. Tools & Workflow
- Any specific tools I should know about? (task trackers, PR workflows, etc.)
- Any terminal or editor preferences that affect how I should work?

## Adaptive Logic

- **Senior developer** → Skip basic explanation preferences, assume high autonomy
- **Prefers terse** → Keep your questions and summaries short too
- **Mentions specific pet peeves** → Acknowledge and confirm you'll avoid them
- **Seems in a hurry** → Offer to do an abbreviated version covering just the essentials

## Interview Flow

1. **Opening**: "I'd like to learn how you work so I can be more helpful. This usually takes 10-15 minutes. Ready to start?"

2. **Questions**: Work through the areas above conversationally. Don't ask every question — adapt based on answers.

3. **Periodic summaries**: Every 5-6 questions, say something like: "So far I'm hearing: experienced full-stack dev, prefers terse responses, high autonomy, careful about quality. Sound right?"

4. **Closing**: Show the complete profile you'll save. Ask: "Does this capture you well? Anything to add or change?"

5. **Save**: Write to `~/.claude/meridian/user-profile.yaml`
