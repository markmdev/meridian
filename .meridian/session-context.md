# Session Context

> **Rolling context file** — Captures important information across sessions. Oldest entries are automatically trimmed when the file exceeds the configured line limit (`session_context_max_lines` in config.yaml).

## How to Use

Append timestamped entries (format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`) with:
- Key decisions made and rationale
- Important discoveries or blockers
- Complex problems solved (and how)
- Context that would be hard to rediscover
- Next steps if work is interrupted

**Do NOT include**: Routine progress updates, obvious information, or content better suited for task-specific docs.
