# Project-level configuration for the Claude workflow

# Project type affects which code guide add-on is loaded:
# - hackathon   → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_HACKATHON.md
# - standard    → baseline only
# - production  → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_PRODUCTION.md
project_type: standard

# Plan review: require plan-reviewer agent before exiting plan mode.
# When false, ExitPlanMode proceeds without review.
plan_review_enabled: true

# Plan review minimum actions: Skip plan-reviewer and feature-writer enforcement
# if fewer than this many actions occurred since entering plan mode.
# Prevents heavyweight review for quick/simple plans. Set to 0 to always enforce.
plan_review_min_actions: 20

# Implementation review: require implementation-reviewer agent before stopping.
# When false, pre-stop hook skips the implementation review section.
implementation_review_enabled: true

# Code review: require code-reviewer agent before stopping (separate from impl review).
# When false, only implementation reviewer runs. Useful when code review is overkill.
code_review_enabled: true

# Pre-compaction sync: prompt agent to save context before conversation compacts.
# When false, no warning is given before compaction.
pre_compaction_sync_enabled: true

# Token threshold for pre-compaction sync warning (default: 150000).
pre_compaction_sync_threshold: 144000

# Folders to ignore for CLAUDE.md review suggestions.
# When agent modifies files, stop hook suggests reviewing CLAUDE.md files
# on the path to those files. These folders are excluded.
# Default: .git, .meridian, node_modules, __pycache__, .venv, venv, dist, build
# claudemd_ignored_folders:
#   - .git
#   - .meridian
#   - node_modules
#   - vendor

# Session context: Rolling context file for cross-session continuity.
# Agent saves important information here; oldest lines trimmed when over limit.
# Set to 0 to disable trimming (unlimited size).
session_context_max_lines: 500

# Worktree context: Shared context across git worktrees.
# Contains high-level summaries of work from all worktrees.
# Oldest lines trimmed when over limit. Set to 0 to disable.
worktree_context_max_lines: 200

# Pebble integration: Git-backed graph issue tracker for AI agents.
# When enabled, agent MUST actively use Pebble to manage work.
# See PEBBLE_GUIDE.md for command reference and principles.
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/pebble
pebble_enabled: false

# Stop hook minimum actions: Skip stop hook prompts if fewer than this many
# tool calls occurred since the user's last input. Prevents interruption
# on quick/simple tasks. Set to 0 to always run stop hook.
stop_hook_min_actions: 20

# Periodic reminder interval: Inject a short reminder about key behaviors
# every N actions (tool calls + user messages). Helps maintain focus during
# long sessions. Resets on session start (startup, compaction, clear).
# Set to 0 to disable.
reminder_interval: 10

# Feature writer enforcement: Require verification features before exiting plan mode.
# When enabled, blocks ExitPlanMode until feature-writer agent has run.
# Disabled by default — enable for projects that need thorough acceptance criteria.
feature_writer_enforcement_enabled: false

# Pebble scaffolder: Auto-invoke pebble-scaffolder after plan approval.
# When false, you can use Pebble without automatic issue scaffolding.
pebble_scaffolder_enabled: true

# Docs researcher write requirement: Block docs-researcher if it didn't write files.
# When false, docs-researcher can complete without writing to api-docs.
docs_researcher_write_required: false

# Plan agent redirect: Redirect Plan agent calls to planning skill.
# When false, allows direct use of Plan agent (loses conversation context).
plan_agent_redirect_enabled: true
