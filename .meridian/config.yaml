# Project-level configuration for the Claude workflow

# Project type affects which code guide add-on is loaded:
# - hackathon   → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_HACKATHON.md
# - standard    → baseline only
# - production  → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_PRODUCTION.md
project_type: standard

# Plan review: require plan-reviewer agent before exiting plan mode.
# When false, ExitPlanMode proceeds without review.
plan_review_enabled: true

# Implementation review: require implementation-reviewer agent before stopping.
# When false, pre-stop hook skips the implementation review section.
implementation_review_enabled: true

# Pre-compaction sync: prompt agent to save context before conversation compacts.
# When false, no warning is given before compaction.
pre_compaction_sync_enabled: true

# Token threshold for pre-compaction sync warning (default: 150000).

# Folders to ignore for CLAUDE.md review suggestions.
# When agent modifies files, stop hook suggests reviewing CLAUDE.md files
# on the path to those files. These folders are excluded.
# Default: .git, .meridian, node_modules, __pycache__, .venv, venv, dist, build
# claudemd_ignored_folders:
#   - .git
#   - .meridian
#   - node_modules
#   - vendor

# Session context: Rolling context file for cross-session continuity.
# Agent saves important information here; oldest lines trimmed when over limit.
# Set to 0 to disable trimming (unlimited size).

# Beads integration: Git-backed graph issue tracker for AI agents.
# When enabled, agent MUST actively use Beads to manage work:
# - Check `bd ready` for unblocked tasks
# - Create issues for new work and discovered bugs
# - Track dependencies between issues
# - Update status as work progresses
# See: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads
beads_enabled: false

# Stop hook minimum actions: Skip stop hook prompts if fewer than this many
# tool calls occurred since the user's last input. Prevents interruption
# on quick/simple tasks. Set to 0 to always run stop hook.
