# Architecture Decision Records

Significant architectural decisions for the project. Each ADR documents the context, decision, and consequences of a choice.

## Frontmatter Format

Every ADR file needs YAML frontmatter so it appears in the agent's context:

```yaml
---
summary: Why we chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB
read_when:
  - database
  - data model
  - schema changes
---
```

## Records

<!-- Add ADR files to this directory with frontmatter -->
