# Project-level configuration for the Claude workflow

# Project type affects which code guide add-on is loaded:
# - hackathon   → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_HACKATHON.md
# - standard    → baseline only
# - production  → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_PRODUCTION.md
project_type: standard

# Plan review: require plan-reviewer agent before exiting plan mode.
# When false, ExitPlanMode proceeds without review.
plan_review_enabled: true

# Plan review minimum actions: Skip plan-reviewer if fewer than this many actions
# occurred since entering plan mode. Prevents heavyweight review for quick plans.
# Set to 0 to always enforce.
plan_review_min_actions: 20

# Code review: require code-reviewer agent before stopping.
# When false, code review is skipped.
code_review_enabled: true

# Pre-compaction sync: prompt agent to save context before conversation compacts.
# When false, no warning is given before compaction.
pre_compaction_sync_enabled: true

# Token threshold for pre-compaction sync warning (default: 150000).
pre_compaction_sync_threshold: 144000

# Auto-compact off: When true, agent stops after pre-compaction sync
# instead of allowing auto-compaction. User must run /clear manually.
# This gives you control over when sessions reset.
auto_compact_off: false

# Pebble integration: Git-backed graph issue tracker for AI agents.
# When enabled, agent MUST actively use Pebble to manage work.
# See PEBBLE_GUIDE.md for command reference and principles.
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/pebble
pebble_enabled: false

# Stop hook minimum actions: Skip stop hook prompts if fewer than this many
# tool calls occurred since the user's last input. Prevents interruption
# on quick/simple tasks. Set to 0 to always run stop hook.

# Pebble scaffolder: Auto-invoke pebble-scaffolder after plan approval.
# When false, you can use Pebble without automatic issue scaffolding.

# File tree: Maximum files shown per directory in the project structure tree.
# Directories with more files show the first N and a "+X truncated" note.
file_tree_max_files_per_dir: 40

# File tree: Additional file extensions to exclude from the project structure tree.
# Built-in exclusions: images, fonts, audio, video, archives, PDFs.
# Format: list of extensions (with or without leading dot).
# file_tree_ignored_extensions:
