CodeRabbit AI reviews PRs automatically after creation. It takes up to 7 minutes for the first review. Check CI/CD status — 'pending' means review in progress.

When feedback arrives, address these comment types:
- Critical — must fix
- Major — must fix
- Minor — must fix
- Out of diff — must fix (issues in related code)
- Nitpick — skip (style preferences)

After fixing issues:
1. Commit and push
2. Reply to each CodeRabbit comment explaining what you fixed
3. Wait for the next review cycle

Stop only when CodeRabbit has no remaining issues and its CI check passes.
